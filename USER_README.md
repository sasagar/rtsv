# Real-time Survey Tool - User Guide

Welcome to the Real-time Survey Tool! This application allows you to participate in live surveys and view results instantly.

## What is this tool?

This tool is designed for interactive sessions, presentations, or events where you want to gather real-time feedback or answers from an audience. It supports various question types and displays results dynamically.

## How to Participate in an Event

If you are an audience member, you will be given a unique **Access Code** for the event. 

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Go to the **Audience View URL**, which will look something like `http://[your-app-domain]/event/[accessCode]`.
    - Replace `[your-app-domain]` with the actual domain where the application is hosted.
    - Replace `[accessCode]` with the specific access code provided for your event.
3.  Once on the page, you will see questions as they are opened by the event administrator. Select your answer(s) or type your response, then submit.

## How to View Live Results (Presenter)

If you are a presenter or event organizer, you can display the live results of questions to your audience.

1.  You will need the **Event ID** for your event.
2.  Open your web browser.
3.  Go to the **Presenter View URL**, which will look something like `http://[your-app-domain]/presenter/[eventId]`.
    - Replace `[your-app-domain]` with the actual domain where the application is hosted.
    - Replace `[eventId]` with the specific ID of your event.
4.  The presenter view will automatically update as participants submit answers and as the administrator displays new questions or results.

## How to Manage Events (Administrator)

If you are an event administrator, you can create new events, manage questions, and control the flow of the survey.

1.  Go to the **Admin Dashboard URL**, which is typically `http://[your-app-domain]/admin`.
2.  You will need to log in with your administrator account. If you don't have one, you'll need an invite code to sign up.
3.  From the dashboard, you can:
    - Create new events.
    - Add, open, close, and delete questions for your events.
    - Display question results on the presenter screen.
    - **Customize Presenter Screen:** Adjust the background and text colors of the presenter view to match your branding or presentation style.
    - Manage invite codes for new administrators.
